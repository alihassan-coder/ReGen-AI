# ReGenAI Agent - Enhanced Capabilities

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Intelligent Conversation Management**
- âœ… Maintains conversation history (last 3 exchanges only)
- âœ… Context window management to prevent token overflow
- âœ… Natural, friendly greetings and introductions
- âœ… Remembers previous questions in the same conversation

### 2. **Smart Farming Advice (LLM-Powered, Not Hardcoded)**
The agent uses AI to dynamically generate advice based on:

#### **Crop Recommendations**
When user asks: "Which crop should I grow?" or "Suggest crops for my farm"
- Analyzes: Location, soil type, climate, water availability, market trends
- Suggests: 2-3 suitable crops with detailed reasons
- Includes: Planting season, expected yield, profitability

#### **Disease Management**
When user asks: "My wheat has yellow spots" or "How to prevent crop diseases?"
- Identifies: Likely diseases based on symptoms and region
- Provides: Prevention methods (organic first)
- Suggests: Treatment options (natural and chemical)

#### **Climate Change Protection**
When user asks: "How to protect crops from climate change?" or "Drought management?"
- Recommends: Drought-resistant crop varieties
- Suggests: Water conservation techniques (drip irrigation, mulching)
- Advises: Climate-smart practices (crop diversification, cover crops)

### 3. **Personalized Using Farm Data**
The agent automatically uses the user's farm profile:
- Location (e.g., Faisalabad, Punjab)
- Soil type (e.g., Loamy, Clay)
- Land size (e.g., 5 acres)
- Water source and irrigation type
- Farming goals (e.g., Climate-safe farming, Profit)
- Crop preferences

### 4. **Context Window Management**
- **Limit**: Only keeps last 3 conversation exchanges (6 messages)
- **Monitoring**: Logs prompt size to track token usage
- **Automatic**: Old messages are automatically removed
- **Efficient**: Prevents API errors from context overflow

## ðŸ“Š How It Works

### Conversation Flow:
```
User: "Hi, my name is Ali"
Agent: Greets warmly, introduces itself, asks how to help

User: "Which crop should I grow?"
Agent: Analyzes farm data â†’ Suggests crops with reasons

User: "Why wheat?"
Agent: Remembers previous suggestion â†’ Explains wheat benefits

User: "How to protect from drought?"
Agent: Provides climate-smart practices for wheat
```

### Context Window Management:
```
Message 1: User asks about crops
Message 2: Agent suggests wheat
Message 3: User asks why wheat
Message 4: Agent explains
Message 5: User asks about irrigation
Message 6: Agent advises
Message 7: User asks about fertilizer
Message 8: Agent responds
[Messages 1-2 are automatically removed to stay within limit]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Example Conversations

### Example 1: Crop Recommendation
```
User: "Suggest me which crop I should grow"

Agent Response:
"Based on your farm in Faisalabad with loamy soil and 5 acres, here are my top recommendations:

1. **Wheat** (November-December planting)
   - Why: Steady market demand, suitable for loamy soil
   - Expected yield: 40-50 maunds/acre
   - Profit potential: High with current prices

2. **Chickpeas (Gram)** (October-November planting)
   - Why: Rising pulse prices, improves soil nitrogen
   - Expected yield: 15-20 maunds/acre
   - Profit potential: Very high due to market trends

3. **Sugarcane** (February-March planting)
   - Why: Good for loamy soil, long-term income
   - Expected yield: 500-600 maunds/acre
   - Profit potential: Stable with mill contracts"
```

### Example 2: Disease Management
```
User: "My wheat crop has rust disease, what should I do?"

Agent Response:
"Wheat rust is common in Punjab during humid conditions. Here's how to manage it:

**Immediate Actions:**
- Remove severely infected plants
- Improve air circulation between rows
- Avoid overhead irrigation

**Organic Treatment:**
- Spray neem oil solution (5ml/liter water)
- Use sulfur-based fungicides
- Apply every 7-10 days

**Chemical Treatment (if severe):**
- Propiconazole-based fungicides
- Follow label instructions carefully

**Prevention for Next Season:**
- Plant rust-resistant varieties (e.g., Faisalabad-2008)
- Ensure proper spacing
- Monitor regularly for early detection"
```

### Example 3: Climate Protection
```
User: "How can I protect my crops from climate change?"

Agent Response:
"For your 5-acre farm in Faisalabad, here are climate-smart practices:

**Water Management:**
- Install drip irrigation system (saves 40-50% water)
- Mulch with crop residue to retain moisture
- Harvest rainwater in ponds

**Crop Selection:**
- Choose drought-tolerant varieties
- Diversify: Mix wheat with pulses
- Consider short-duration crops

**Soil Health:**
- Add organic compost (improves water retention)
- Practice minimal tillage
- Grow cover crops in off-season

**Risk Management:**
- Stagger planting dates
- Keep emergency irrigation ready
- Join crop insurance programs"
```
